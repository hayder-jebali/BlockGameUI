  Should show here tokens holders sorted by amount.<br>
  Should ask the blockchain to list all transactions related to the contract and sort it.<br>
  A simpler way would have to implement sort and list all token holders directly in the contract, which will enlight the javascript code (the front end code, to be more generic).
